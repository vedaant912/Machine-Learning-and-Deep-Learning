# Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
ðŸš€ Exploring Machine Learning & Deep Learning | Personal and Guided Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning Repo! I'm passionate about diving deep into the world of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). Here, you'll find a collection of my personal and guided projects where I experiment with various ML/DL algorithms and techniques to enhance my skills.

1. [Image Segmentation with Pytorch](https://github.com/vedaant912/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/blob/main/1_Copy_of_Deep_Learning_with_PyTorch_ImageSegmentation.ipynb). Used Unet Architecture to get the segmentaiton of the image. For this instance, took segmentation of human. Trained on a dataset consisting of human.
    * Skills : Convolutional Neural Network, Autoencoder, Python Programming, PyTorch.
2. [Deep Learning with PyTorch : Siamese Network](https://github.com/vedaant912/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/blob/main/2_Copy_of_Deep_Learning_with_PyTorch_Siamese_Network.ipynb). Trained a network using Triplet loss function. Create Anchor, Positive, Negative image datase, which was used as input to the triplet loss function.
    * Applications : Face Recognition, Signature Checking, Person re-identification, etc.
    * Skills : Pytorch, Triplet Loss function, State of the Art architecture - efficientnet_b0
3. [Deep Learning with PyTorch : Facial Expression Recognition](https://github.com/vedaant912/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/blob/main/3_Copy_of_Facial_Expression_Recognition_with_PyTorch.ipynb). Load pretrained SOTA model to train on facial expression dataset. Classify on the basis of expression into 7 different classes.
    * Skills : Convolutional Neural Nework, Classifier
4. [Naive Bayes Classifier](https://github.com/vedaant912/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/tree/main/4_NaiveBayes)
5. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/vedaant912/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/tree/main/5_LinearRegression)
    * Multiple Linear Regression
    * Multicollinearity Linear Regression
6. [SVM](https://github.com/vedaant912/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/tree/main/6_SVM) (Support Vector Machine)
7. [K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/vedaant912/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/tree/main/7_K_Means_Algorithm)
    * Using clustering class and kmeans class implemented K-means clustering algorithm
    * Usage of dataclass for Clustering : locations (centroid), vectors
    * matplotlib scatter plot to visualize all the data points with 5 centroids.
