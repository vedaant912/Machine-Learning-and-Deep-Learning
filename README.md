# Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
Some guided and personal projects related to machine learning and deep learning. Learning ML and DL algorithms and techniques to imporve my skills.

1. Image Segmentation with Pytorch. Used Unet Architecture to get the segmentaiton of the image. For this instance, took segmentation of human. Trained on a dataset consisting of human.
    * Skills : Convolutional Neural Network, Autoencoder, Python Programming, PyTorch.
2. Deep Learning with PyTorch : Facial Expression Recognition. Load pretrained SOTA model to train on facial expression dataset. Classify on the basis of expression into 7 different classes.
    * Skills : Convolutional Neural Nework, Classifier
3. Deep Learning with PyTorch : Siamese Network. Trained a network using Triplet loss function. Create Anchor, Positive, Negative image datase, which was used as input to the triplet loss function.
    * Applications : Face Recognition, Signature Checking, Person re-identification, etc.
    * Skills : Pytorch, Triplet Loss function, State of the Art architecture - efficientnet_b0
4. Naive Bayes Classifier
5. Linear Regression
    * Multiple Linear Regression
    * Multicollinearity Linear Regression
6. SVM (Support Vector Machine)
7. K-Means Clustering
