# Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
Some guided and personal projects related to machine learning and deep learning. Learning ML and DL algorithms and techniques to imporve my skills.

1. Image Segmentation with Pytorch. Used Unet Architecture to get the segmentaiton of the image. For this instance, took segmentation of human. Trained on a dataset consisting of human.
    * Skills : Convolutional Neural Network, Autoencoder, Python Programming, PyTorch.
2. Deep Learning with PyTorch : Facial Expression Recognition. Load pretrained SOTA model to train on facial expression dataset. Classify on the basis of expression into 7 different classes.
    * Skills : Convolutional Neural Nework, Classifier
