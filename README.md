# Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
Some guided and personal projects related to machine learning and deep learning. Learning ML and DL algorithms and techniques to imporve my skills.

* Image Segmentation with Pytorch. Used Unet Architecture to get the segmentaiton of the image. For this instance, took segmentation of human. Trained on a dataset consisting of human.
    * Skills : Convolutional Neural Network, Autoencoder, Python Programming, PyTorch.
* Deep Learning with PyTorch : Siamese Network. Implemented siamese network. Trained simple Siamese Network for person re-identification.
